# ðŸ¤“ Prologue
I believe the Jin dynasty was blessed with spiritual essence and nurtured excellence. Yet heaven sent down chaos, the four seas were in turmoil, the Five Barbarians held power, the Six Departments lost order, and the Seven Temples fell from grace.

Moved by this, I often contemplate the rise and fall of ancient dynasties.

In the year of Jiazi, when turmoil spread across the land and plague ran rampant, I stayed behind closed doors. 

There I found Wang's "History of Wei, Jin, and the Northern and Southern Dynasties," which I studied day and night, finding much resonance within.

Alas, my memory proves dull, and much was forgotten over time. Thus, I became determined to write, resolved to spread Chinese civilization to all corners of the world.

Despite my limitations, I created a Western YouTube channel, telling our dynasty's stories in English. In my writing, the "Book of Jin" has been my constant companion.

Initially unfamiliar with classical Chinese, I immersed myself in study, translating to English. Through explaining profound principles in simple terms, I began to understand the ancients' true intent.

However, video editing proved to be excessively laborious. Though I temporarily suspended this endeavor, my determination to translate and narrate remained unchanged.

This spring, I learned Python and studied AI algorithms, but with limited energy, this pursuit was shelved.

Recently, during my leisure time, I suddenly realized that AI could assist in my translation work. 

While the Twenty-Four Histories contain a vast collection of forty million words, I have a particular fondness for the hundred and three volumes of the Book of Jin - perhaps this, too, is heaven's will.

The ancients said: "Many begin well, few finish well." Now, with AI's assistance, completing this unfinished work would be splendid! Thus, I spent two days crafting these scripts.

Though lacking in talent, I wish to follow Xuanling's aspiration, chronicle the rise and fall of the Jin, and illuminate the reasons for their success and failure. With AI as my aid, bridging past and present, I hope not to disappoint this heart's resolve.
